my portfolio:
This is my wife's artwork website. It is a project that I am doing for Code Louisville's front end web development course. 
The nav bar should be responsive using the mobile feature in the dev tools and the carousel is at the bottom. All of my social media and etsy links work. Only the contact and artwork links in the nav bar work properly.
